#Atmel Projects
##AVR and ARM 

This is my learning repo for various Atmel hardware.
Update February 28, 2016:
* Already know some AVR-C, but want to learn ARM MCU
*   Working on building a development board for Atmel ARM to learn how to go from concept -> constructed PCB -> software -> finished product.
